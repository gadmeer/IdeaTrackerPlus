> This is a fork of the amazing [IdeasTracker app](https://github.com/nserguier/IdeasTracker) by [@nserguier](https://github.com/nserguier), with many optimizations, fixes and modifications by [the contributors](https://github.com/IdeaTrackerPlus/IdeaTrackerPlus/graphs/contributors). This project is maintained by [@manparvesh](https://github.com/manparvesh).  

<b>A To-Do list for your ideas:</b>

Idea Tracker Plus is a task and project management app that would help you keep track of your great ideas. It is almost like a To-Do list, but more specific for just your ideas: no annoying reminders, or big red “overdue task” notification.  
Your ideas/tasks are clearly separated by project, no need for tags or filters, you can simply focus on one project at a time.
